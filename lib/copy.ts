/**
 * Every user-facing word in the app, in one place.
 *
 * Edit here and the app changes — nothing below is duplicated in a screen.
 * Anything taking arguments is a function; everything else is a plain string.
 *
 * `npm run copy:report` dumps this to docs/copy.md and docs/copy.json if you
 * want to read or mark it up outside the editor.
 *
 * House style:
 *   - One sentence. If it needs two, it needs fewer words.
 *   - No dashes joining clauses. Split the sentence or cut the clause.
 *   - State the fact, stop. No reassurance, no commentary, no jokes.
 *   - Everything renders lowercase, so capitals here are only for readability.
