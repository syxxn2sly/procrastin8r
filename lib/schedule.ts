 * which is the whole promise of "set the anchors once".
 *
 * The work blocks are generated from the user's own Next 3, not from fixtures:
 * the hard task goes in the medication peak window and the quick ones stack up
 * before lunch. A schedule that names someone else's tasks is furniture.
 *
 * Blocks marked `suggest` are proposals: they render dashed and do nothing
 * until the user accepts them. The app is allowed to have opinions; it is not
 * allowed to put things on your day without asking.
